# number-guess-game
A basic number guessing game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

I created this game using some of the basic JavaScript fundamentals that I've learned over the past few weeks. I wrote all of the code from scratch, including the HTML and CSS. 

The game is fairly simple, and the idea is that JavaScript file will generate a random integer value between 1-20 (inclusive). The "Secret Number" won't be revealed to the player. The player starts with a score of 20 and tries to guess the secret number. The player may use the basic hints generated by the web page. Each incorrect guess lowers the player's score by 1 point. If the player guesses correctly, the program will save the player's current score to the "highscore" field (as long as it's higher than the previous highscore value). The player can continue to play the game by clicking the "Again!" button and the highscore will be saved. If the browser refreshes the page, the highscore value will be lost.

Enjoy my first official JavaScript project!
More complex projects are on the way! :)
